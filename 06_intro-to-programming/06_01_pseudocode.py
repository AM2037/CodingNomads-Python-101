# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.

# Create a dictionary of adoptable kittens to share with friends as key:value pairs
# For keys type each of their names followed by values that list if they are adoptable or not
# i.e. kittens_for_sale = { "Pumpkin": "Adoptable", ... } 
# Next create prompt that asks friends which ones they think are cute
